## Training module on Pytorch for image classification


This training module is based off of the [Deep Learning with Pytorch: A 60 minute blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) tutorial by Soumith Chintala.

It has been updated and customized for running on HiPerGator by Matt Gitzendanner.

## Contents:

This training module has four notebooks:
* [Introduction to PyTorch and Tensors](1_tensor_tutorial.ipynb)
* [Automatic Differentiation, Backpropagation and Gradients with autograd](2_autograd_tutorial.ipynb)
* [Neural Networks and Loss functions](3_neural_networks_tutorial.ipynb)
* [Training a CNN Classifier for image recognition](4_cifar10_tutorial.ipynb)

You can run these notebooks in [JupyterHub on HiPerGator](https://jupyterhub.rc.ufl.edu/) or open them in the [Google Colavoratory](https://colab.research.google.com/github/UFResearchComputing/DL_pytorch_CNN/blob/main/1_tensor_tutorial.ipynb).
